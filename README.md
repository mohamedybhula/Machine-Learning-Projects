# Machine-Learning-Projects
A compilation of beginner-focused Machine Learning projects I have completed, which I hope showcases my ability to handle large volumes of data, explore, analyse and ultimately create useful models with the data.
A range of data science and machine learning Python libraries have been used in these projects, such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn and Matlplotlib.
